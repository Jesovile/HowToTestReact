# Testing of React component

This is a project demonstrate how we can to test React-components.\
`api` folder contains function imitate api-call and wrappers for using in components\
`components/UserCard` folder contains a simple component with api calling
`UserCard.test.js` file contains unit-tests for this component 

In this unit test you can show how we can mock api-calls and wrappers to prevent api-calling during running unit-test

I use `jest` and `@testing-library/react` for this purpose.
